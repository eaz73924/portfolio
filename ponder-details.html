              <h2>Creating a mindful fishing game for the Apple Vision Pro</h2>
              <h3>Project Overview</h3>
              <p>
                This project is being created for the New Media Capstone class at UGA. 
                It is currently in progress and the photos shown are a beta stage of the app. 
                For this project, I am acting as a sole developer on a team of 5. 
                We were tasked with researching, designing, and creating an app for the Apple Vision Pro. 
                We decided to make a mindful fishing game, where a user can take a break from their surroundings and relax in our mixed reality game. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I am developing the app for this project in XCode using SwiftUI. 
                Prior to this project, I had developed some simple apps for iOS with swiftUI, so I was familiar with Swift and XCode, but was new to developing for Vision Pro, or any AR application for that matter. 
                My team knew that we wanted to take advantage of the headset's mixed reality, and I knew this would be my biggest hurdle as developer. 
                To keep track of development and features I need to add, I have been using Trello, and Git to track my changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                My most used resource for developing this app is the developer documentation from Apple. 
                It provides comprehensive information on SwiftUI's APIs, Swift language features, and best practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this stage in development, I have completed an interactive pond, where fish "swim" across. When the user pinches a fish, a pop up appears with more information about the fish that they just caught.
                Here, the user can change the fishes name, or click a share button to share their catch with friends. 
                Then, the user can view all of the fish that they have collected in their journal, an interactive fish archive. 
                This screen is set up as a LazyVGrid, which the user can change the size of in real-time. 
                As the user continues to catch more fish and add them to their collection, the journal continues to update. 
                Before the apps release, I am hoping to add challenges to the app and a more immersive pond. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We are hoping for Ponder to be released to the App Store in Spring of 2024!
